- 👋 Hi, I’m @antoineww
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly frontend projects, my favs use React / React-Native; JS development really. 
However, I mostly handle web & mobile app projects in many languages, even full-stack projects.
- 🌱 I’m always learning something; mainly clean techniques that are overall re-usable in mosts projects. 
I gotta think about my future-self and teammates; how would they feel working after my old-self's code? not confused & grateful is my answer 😁
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small/big tech companies/projects and start-ups to get release their MVPs (Minimum Viable Product).
